/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for Voaya User Profiles
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model, ensuring that only authenticated users can access and modify their own profile data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All user profile data is stored in a document at `/users/{userId}`.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only read and write their own profile data.
 * - Listing all user profiles is disallowed.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `id` field within the UserProfile document is validated against the `userId` in the path to ensure data consistency and enforce ownership. This avoids costly `get()` calls.
